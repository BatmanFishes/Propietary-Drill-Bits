# Well Identification Analysis Results

## üéØ Key Findings

Based on the analysis of your drilling bit data, here are the definitive answers about well identification:

### **Are License Numbers and API/UWI Numbers the Same?**

**‚ùå NO - They are DIFFERENT identifier systems**

### üìä Evidence from the Data

| Identifier Type | Reed Data | Ulterra Data | Format |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **License Numbers** | 18,618 records (100%) | 0 records (0%) | 5-12 characters (e.g., "12059", "27170") |
| **API/UWI Numbers** | 18,482 records (99.3%) | 2,084 records (85%) | 16 characters (Reed) / 6 characters (Ulterra) |
| **Well Names** | 18,618 records (100%) | 2,294 records (94%) | Text strings |

### üîç Detailed Analysis

#### Reed Data (Canadian Format)
- **License Numbers**: Short numeric codes (5-12 digits) - Canadian drilling license system
- **API/UWI Numbers**: 16-digit UWI format (Canadian standard) - e.g., "103041401029W100"
- **Coverage**: Both have excellent coverage (99-100%)
- **Uniqueness**: 3,669 unique licenses vs 2,810 unique UWIs

#### Ulterra Data (US/International Format)  
- **License Numbers**: Not provided in their data
- **API Numbers**: 6-digit codes - e.g., "517440", "489483"
- **Coverage**: 85% of records have API numbers
- **Format**: Shorter than Canadian UWI format

### üéØ **Improved Well Counting Results**

Using the new **Composite Well Identifier** approach:

| Method | Well Count | Change from Original |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Original (Well Names)** | 4,476 wells | *Baseline* |
| **Improved (Composite ID)** | **4,385 wells** | **-91 wells (-2.0%)** |

### üìã **Composite Identifier Breakdown**

The new system uses a priority-based approach:

1. **Primary**: API/UWI Numbers (93.0% - 4,077 wells)
2. **Secondary**: License Numbers (0.6% - 28 wells)  
3. **Fallback**: Well Names (2.8% - 122 wells)
4. **Unknown**: Missing all IDs (3.6% - 158 wells)

### üè≠ **Why This Matters**

#### **Previous Issues with Well Names:**
- Same wells had different naming conventions between sources
- Slight variations in spelling, spacing, abbreviations
- Led to **overcounting** of unique wells

#### **Benefits of Composite Identifier:**
- **More Accurate**: Uses standardized numeric identifiers when possible
- **Comprehensive**: Falls back gracefully when numeric IDs missing
- **Consistent**: Same approach across all data sources
- **Traceable**: Can see which identifier type was used for each well

### üîß **System Updates Made**

1. **Added Composite Well ID** to all integrated data
2. **Updated Quality Reports** to use accurate well counts
3. **Enhanced Source Summary** with identifier breakdown
4. **Improved Deduplication** logic for cross-source analysis

### üìà **Impact on Analysis**

The **4,385 unique wells** (vs 4,476 previously) is a more accurate count because:

- **Reed wells**: Identified primarily by 16-digit UWI numbers
- **Ulterra wells**: Identified by 6-digit API numbers  
- **Cross-source matching**: Prevented double-counting of same wells
- **Quality assurance**: Flagged wells missing proper identifiers

### üí° **Recommendations**

1. **Use Composite Well ID** for all well counting and analysis
2. **API/UWI numbers** are the most reliable for unique well identification
3. **License numbers** provide good supplementary identification for Canadian wells
4. **Well names** should only be used when numeric identifiers are unavailable

### üéâ **Conclusion**

Your data now has **proper well identification** that:
- Distinguishes between different identifier systems
- Provides accurate unique well counts
- Enables reliable cross-source analysis
- Maintains data quality and traceability

The system is now ready for accurate well-based performance analysis and reporting!
