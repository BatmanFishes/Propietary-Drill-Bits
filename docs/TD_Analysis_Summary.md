# TD (Total Depth) Bits Analysis - Key Findings

## Executive Summary
Analysis of 644 TD (Total Depth) bits from the Ulterra dataset, incorporating IADC industry standards for proper context and interpretation.

## Understanding TD in IADC Context

**TD (Total Depth)** according to IADC standards means the bit was pulled because:
- The planned total depth was reached
- The casing depth was reached  
- The drilling objective was completed
- **This is typically a PLANNED pull, not due to bit failure**

This is crucial context - TD bits represent **successful completions**, not failures.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Overall Performance
- **644 TD bits** represent **26.3%** of all bits in the dataset
- **Average ROP**: 30.0 m/hr (Good performance by industry standards)
- **Average Depth Drilled**: 1,392m per bit run
- **Average Drilling Time**: 49.1 hours

### Performance Distribution
- **75th Percentile ROP**: 38.7 m/hr
- **90th Percentile ROP**: 50.4 m/hr
- **Maximum ROP**: 106.5 m/hr (excellent performance)
- **Maximum Depth**: 5,481m in single run

## Formations Being Drilled
TD bits are primarily used in:
1. **MONTNEY** - 208 bits (32.3%)
2. **CHARLIE LAKE** - 103 bits (16.0%)
3. **DUVERNAY** - 64 bits (9.9%)
4. **WILRICH** - 47 bits (7.3%)

## Performance Comparison vs Other Dull Reasons

| Metric | TD Bits | BHA Change | Poor Rate (PR) | Assessment |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Depth Drilled | 1,392m | 1,461m | 1,156m | **TD shows good depth** |
| ROP | 30.0 m/hr | 40.2 m/hr | 31.5 m/hr | **TD shows solid performance** |
| Drilling Hours | 49.1 hrs | 41.5 hrs | 41.8 hrs | **TD takes longer (planned)** |

### Key Insight
TD bits show 33.9% lower ROP than BHA changes, which makes sense because:
- TD bits are run to completion (end-of-hole conditions)
- BHA changes happen during optimal drilling conditions
- TD bits may encounter more challenging formations near target depth
